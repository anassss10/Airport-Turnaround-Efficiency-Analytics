# Airport-Turnaround-Efficiency-Analytics
Data Analysis Project Showcasing Airtport Turnaround Efficiency Using Sql and Power Bi


**Project Overview**

Airport turnaround time is a critical factor in airline profitability and passenger satisfaction. Delays during ground operations directly impact flight schedules, resource utilization, and operational costs. This project focuses on analyzing airport ground operations, flight delays, and staff efficiency using SQL and Power BI to uncover delay drivers, operational bottlenecks, and manpower inefficiencies.
The final output is a multi-page executive Power BI dashboard designed for airport leadership to make data-driven operational decisions.

**Business Objectives**
